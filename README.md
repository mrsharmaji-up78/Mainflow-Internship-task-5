Task 5: Classification Tasks Overview
This task focuses on classification problems in data science using machine learning techniques. The objective is to develop predictive models that classify data into distinct categories based on input features. The task consists of two key projects:

1️⃣ Student Pass/Fail Prediction
Objective: Build a predictive model to determine whether a student will pass or fail based on study hours and attendance.

Approach:

Perform data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends and relationships.
Train a Logistic Regression model using study hours and attendance as features.
Evaluate the model’s performance using accuracy and a confusion matrix.
Derive insights into key factors influencing student success.
Expected Deliverables:
✔️ Trained classification model
✔️ Model performance metrics (accuracy, confusion matrix)
✔️ Key insights on student performance predictors

2️⃣ Sentiment Analysis with Natural Language Processing (NLP)
Objective: Analyze customer reviews and classify them as positive or negative using NLP techniques.

Approach:

Preprocess text data by removing stopwords, punctuation, and special characters, and applying tokenization and lemmatization.
Convert text into numerical format using TF-IDF vectorization.
Train a Logistic Regression model for sentiment classification.
Evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Expected Deliverables:
✔️ Cleaned and preprocessed text dataset
✔️ Sentiment classification model
✔️ Model evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)
✔️ Insights on common patterns in positive and negative reviews

Tools & Technologies Used
Data Analysis & Visualization: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Machine Learning & NLP: scikit-learn, NLTK, spaCy
This task provides hands-on experience in classification modeling and natural language processing, helping to develop key skills in data science and machine learning.
